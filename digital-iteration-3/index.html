<h2>High Steaks!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game allows you to chef up your own signature dish instead of creating from a preset.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The player gets to click through multiple screens and is prevented from selecting too many ingredients.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to 'stage' several scenes for a game instead of sticking to the same screen throughout the game.
I better understand how to use touch events and tweens for animations as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made my own gradient for the cooking scale, however the remaining assets I got from the following sites.
<ul>
<li>Kitchen Background: <a href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-vector/cartoon-kitchen-workspace-restaurant-kitchen_4139336.htm">Kitchen</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Start Button: <a href="http://pixelartmaker.com/art/8f1a812495b34d8">Start</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pixel Food: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/meminmamon/art/Pixel-Food-assets-for-Pikuniku-Battle-free-to-use-727615934">Food</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stop Button: <a href="http://pixelartmaker.com/art/3fe74b98f81d8ed">Stop</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Background Music: <a href="https://patrickdearteaga.com/arcade-music/">Music</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I followed the tween animation example for pausing and resuming events as well the example for inciting an
event when clicking a specific object. I also looked at the Phaser documentation for onClick events and Tweens. 
<ul>
<li>Tween Resume/Pause: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/tweens/pause-and-resume-all">Tween Example</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On-Down Event: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/game-object/on-down-event">On-Down Example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Cook up your signature dish chef!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I did use one of the optional themes/challenges for the week.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game includes mouse input and deterministic gameplay. Also, it is a casual cooking game with an achiever playstyle.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game is evaluating the mechanic of the player selecting their choice of ingredients to cook with the correct timming.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to like the feel of the game with the music and different options of ingredients. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player selects the start button to move on to the next screen where they must up to three ingredients for cooking.
After selecting the next button, they must hit the stop button at the right time to get the best cook on their dish.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player must observe the best time for hitting the stop button. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a chef on the rise and need to come up with your signature dish to serve to all the customers
at your restaurant. You hope to carefully craft and cook the best dish!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I hope to reach cooking enthusiasts and casual players of any age and background.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The play time is just a couple minutes if the player zooms through all the screens. 
</li>
