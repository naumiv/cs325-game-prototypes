<h2>Boo!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game allows you to explore a house as a ghost!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The camera follows the player around a custom map that I created.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to create a tile map using the software Tiled and use the camera features of Phaser. 
The hardest part of making the game was getting the tile map to work. I had to convert it to a
background png for the moment to make the game work, but in the next iteration I plan on having
the tile map fully functional. The easiest part was adding the music.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I did make a custom tile map, however, I used a pre-made sprite sheet with the different tiles.
<ul>
<li>Sprite sheet for tiles: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/roguelikerpg-pack-1700-tiles">Tiles</a></li>

<li>Pacman Ghost: <a href="https://www.cleanpng.com/free/pacman.html">Pac Ghost</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Background Music: <a href="https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/scary-horror-music/8">Music</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Follow-Zoom: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/camera/follow-zoom">Follow Example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'm trying to reach horror or paranormal enthusiasts.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
You can explore for as long as you like.
