<h2>Dig!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game takes the concept of a paleontological dig site and turns it into a chance-based game. This is different from other games that may have the same premise but make into a more puzzle, bone-assembly game or adventure game like Jurassic Park: The Game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I included the feel of a day to night cycle by animating the background and creating custom gradients for the sky. I was able to incorporate background music as well as action based sound effects. I also included a variety of both negative and positive "events" that could happen to the player, which would effect their inventory and rank in real time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to work with data objects in Phaser and link it to a specific image, which allowed me to treat the images like objects with fields i.e. money. This was my first time working with audio as well, so I learned how to play it in the background and only play when linked to a specific action. Similarly, this was my first time using mouse / point controls, so I now better understand the Javascript and function calls related to it. A major part of the game was updating the values after the player clicked, so I needed to learn to handle those updates with Javascript functions, which took a while. Finally, I also implemented a animated background which was a little different from creating a player-controlled sprite, so I now better understand the differences between the two. The background used a timer so I read the documentation and learned more about the timing abilities of phaser.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created the textbox asset and sky color gradients myself. The rest of the images and sounds are linked below.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not follow a specific game from Phaser, however, I used the following Phaser examples in combination to create my game. I also read the documentation for various Phaser objects such as text, image, data, etc. 
<ul>
<li>Animating the background: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/animation/animation-from-png-sequence">PNG Animation</a></li>	
<li>Changing data events: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/components/data/change-data-event">Data Component</a></li>
<li>Playing audio: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/audio/html5-audio/play-audio-file">Audio</a></li>	
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Dig to find out if you're the next paleontologist prodigy!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the theme of paleontologist and the challenge of randomizing something that traditionally would not be randomized. In this case, I chose to randomize the starting player money.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used mouse, a lot of randomness, achiever, and incremental game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
It's evaluating the effect of random player events.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have fun and feel like they're immersed in the experience of a being a paleontologist at a dig site. I hope the music and visuals add to that ambience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player clicks anywhere on the screen to dig, which costs $100. The effect of their dig is displayed on the textbox. He or she continues digging until they run out of money. Each dig can result in a positive event like finding a fossil or a negative event like the excavation site collapsing. Negative events may cause the player to lose additional money on top of the dig cost. As the player finds more fossils, their rank in the paleontological world increases!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is targeted to a wide variety of ages and levels of experience since the input is very simple. However, since the game requires the player to be able to read, I would say the age range is 5 plus. It is also geared towards dinosaur enthusiasts since that is the premise.  
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The play time depends on how much money the player starts with and how fast they click. In general, if the player takes a medium pace and starts with a modest amount of money, the game only takes a few minutes.
