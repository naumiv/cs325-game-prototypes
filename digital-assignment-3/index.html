<h2>Dig!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game takes the concept of a paleontological dig site and turns it into a chance-based game. This is different from other games that may have the same premise but make into a more puzzle, bone-assembly game or adventure game like Jurassic Park: The Game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I included the feel of a day to night cycle by animating the background and creating custom gradients for the sky. I was able to incorporate background music as well as action based sound effects. I also included a variety of both negative and positive "events" that could happen to the player, which would effect their inventory and rank in real time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to work with data objects in Phaser and link it to a specific image, which allowed me to treat the images like objects with fields i.e. money. This was my first time working with audio as well, so I learned how to play it in the background and only play when linked to a specific action. Similarly, this was my first time using mouse / point controls, so I now better understand the Javascript and function calls related to it. A major part of the game was updating the values after the player clicked, so I needed to learn to handle those updates with Javascript functions, which took a while. Finally, I also implemented a animated background which was a little different from creating a player-controlled sprite, so I now better understand the differences between the two. The background used a timer so I read the documentation and learned more about the timing abilities of phaser.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created the textbox asset and sky color gradients myself. The rest of the images and sounds are linked below.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
